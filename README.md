 I downloaded the data from: https://s3.amazonaws.com/baywheels-data/index.html, 
and I chose to take data for 2019 bike trips.



## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, I found how the months and days effect the number of 
bike rides and duration. Usually the number of rides were high during warm 
months like July, June, September and low during cold and short days month, 
December. Also, the number of rides were high during the weekdays, but
the duration of rides was high during Weekends. The number of users were high
 as subscribers, almost 4 times more than customers. The rides were highest 
during office times (8-12 PM and 4-8PM), and also, the average ride duration 
was always high in customers than subscribers.

## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I basically focussed on number of rides according to months, 
days and time of the say. After that I chose to focus on types of customers, 
how the distributin is 80:20 percent between subscribers and customers. Than I 
checked the duration of rides in month and day according to 2 types of
customers, and than number of rides too. In last section, I combined all 3 things, 
type of customer, rides duration and month/days to check the whole
picture altogether.
